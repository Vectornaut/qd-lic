# WIP Lawson's Klein Bottle

It uses the [regl](https://github.com/regl-project/regl) library for interfacing with WebGL and uses [this shader technique](https://observablehq.com/@rreusser/faking-transparency-for-3d-surfaces) for drawing the surface.

There are some shared dependencies a couple directories up, so you'll need to run `npm install` both in the root project directory and in this directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rreusser/explorations.git
cd explorations
npm install
cd posts/lawsons-klein-bottle
npm install
npm start
```
